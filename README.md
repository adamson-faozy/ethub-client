# Simple react Typescript project
This project is a simple DAPP that connects to python flask rest api
it uses wallet address and metamask signins as user authentication
no user authorisation is setup
sessions are server side and http only so safe relatively

# Future Plans
Finish up the project obviously
still many boiler plate areas

checklists are:

-complete nav and header

-Style up the Messages List

-Add functionality to send messages via  transaction signable with metamask or if not possible we ask users for private key to sign transactions/calculate nonce
