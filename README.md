# Simple react Typescript project
This project is a simple DAPP that connects to python flask rest api
it uses wallet address and metamask signins as user authentication
no user authorisation is setup
sessions are server side and http only so safe relatively

# Future Plans
Finish up the project obviously
still many boiler plate areas

checklists are:
-complete nav and header
-Style up the Messages List
-Add functionality to send messahes via  transaction signable with metamasek or if not possible we ask users for provate key to sigh transactions/calculate nonce
